  Santa upgraded his sleigh and decided to let his best elves build a remote controlled, reindeer powered spaceship.
  This spaceship has a full fledged application giving him info in real time about his reindeer's health and hunger levels.
  The secure elves of the North told him it's the best technology has to offer.
  Santa hired you to verify their claim! Don't let him down, or else...
