    This is the first level of `The Box`.
    Connect to the box via ssh at `level0@box1.j3romee.com` with the password `g00dLuck_h@ve_fun`

    Your goal is to find a way to get access the next user (`level1`) and privesc your way up to the last level.

    The challenge is separated in multiple parts on this website but everything run on the same box.
    Your end goal is to collect all the flags reach the last level.

    /!\ There is no bruteforcing involved in this challenge. There is always a way to get to the next level /!\

    You don't necessarly need to do all the level sequentially ;)
